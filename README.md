# SQL_Project_and_GUI

Here is my laboratory work for the 'Database' course during the first semester of the second year at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca. The .sql files correspond to my work with a recipes database, involving database creation and population. The .java files represent the GUI implemented for accessing the database, and the .txt file contains the queries necessary for its functionality.
